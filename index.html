<!-- /* multiple sections on your site. 
            One that lists the fish you currently own, and another one that lists all the places that you've visited to harvest the fish..
    content on the right side of the list of fish that explained the process of 
            keeping the tank clean and the water at the right salinity and temperature
            I'd love to have that so I can put my thoughts in there."
            will need an <aside> element on that page.
    All the sites had a navigation bar at the top.
         places an emphasis on navigation bar. 
         make it look clean and minimal
        I don't think it's needed since all the information is going to be on one page.
        when there is more information in the future, I can have you add another page and then I can have a navigation bar.        
    had a part that listed travel tips for people who love to scuba and harvest fish.            
        I would like to provide a few quotes to help people."
                Where would you like that to appear/ "Right above the list of locations."
    The details of each fish should include the image, the species, its length, what you named the fish, where you harvested it, and what it eats.            

LOOK UP <ASIDE>
